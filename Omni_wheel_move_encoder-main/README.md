# **8 Directional Movement of Omni Bot Based on Encoder Feedback**
The bot is set to run a certain distance given in input. This is achieved by calculating the no of rotations required and setting the motors to run until those no of rotations are achieved (this can be known by encoder feedback).
## Movements
In total there are 4 basic axes of movement. In all the axes the bot can go forward and backward.
