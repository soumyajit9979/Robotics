# ArUco
This repo is for maintaining all the codes related to ArUco markers detection and pose estimantion

If there’s a version upgrade, check the below link for changes in attributes.

https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/d9/d6a/group__aruco.html

there will be version issues. So we have to use the attributes according to the version of opencv used. Eg, Dictionary_get() and DetectMarkers() don’t work in 4.7
Use this for follow-along and reference: https://github.com/niconielsen32/ComputerVision/tree/master/ArUco
Building an Augmented Reality Application with ArUco Marker Detection in OpenCV
For camera calibration, add images that you take of the aruco markers and put them in a folder, naming them in a sequence. The folder and the code file should be in the same directory.
